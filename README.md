# Tileeditor
Html5 Tile editor for 2D games

Fork of the Tizzio tile-editor, this editor will be improved on stability and interface in order to create a totally functional and User-friendly tool, more dynamic and easy to use than now.

Here some good practice for the code development for this project:

- The code must be commented and well indented (a Tab or two spaces are fine), and a space must occur between two different elements/funcitons.
- Function must be writtend with camel-style naming (ThisIsMyFunction();), and ";" have to be present at every line end that requires it.
- All the Javascript loop or logical function must be in expanded syntax (if(){[...]} and not if()[...]) and every command line must be on a different line.
- The CSS code can be on one line or multiple, depends on the quantity of rules, but it must be divided as per TOC in the head of the CSS file, even the same element can be called multiple times depending on the type of rule you want to assign.
